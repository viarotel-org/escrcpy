However, these extensions do not affect the core of Scrcpy. To implement this particular feature, I would have to modify the underlying Scrcpy code, which would make it more difficult for Escrcpy to stay in sync with Scrcpy&#39;s updates, and the drawbacks would outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Therefore, after careful consideration, we have decided to adopt the existing solution and look forward to Scrcpy adding native support for an interactive control bar in the future.</p><h3 id="some-devices-can-see-screenshots-after-connecting-but-cannot-operate" tabindex="-1">Some devices can see screenshots after connecting but cannot operate <a class="header-anchor" href="#some-devices-can-see-screenshots-after-connecting-but-cannot-operate" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Some devices can see screenshots after connecting but cannot operate&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>Note: For Xiaomi phones in particular, it requires not only enabling USB debugging but also enabling USB debugging (Security Settings), which is to allow modifying permissions or simulating clicks via USB debugging.</p></blockquote><p>Please refer to the detailed instructions under <a href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy/blob/master/FAQ.md#mouse-and-keyboard-do-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reasons why mouse and keyboard do not work</a></p><h3 id="downloading-prompts-antivirus-detection-causing-unable-to-download-normally" tabindex="-1">Downloading prompts antivirus detection causing unable to download normally <a class="header-anchor" href="#downloading-prompts-antivirus-detection-causing-unable-to-download-normally" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Downloading prompts antivirus detection causing unable to download normally&quot;">​</a></h3><blockquote><p>After feedback, Windows Defender may occasionally block the software packages from being downloaded due to lack of certificate signing.
